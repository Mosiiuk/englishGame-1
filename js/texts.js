    text: `Marty Mckay was already five years old, but he was still the baby of the family. </br> "Can I have some tea too?" Marty asked his mother.She drank her tea from a beautiful cup and stirred it with a silver spoon. </br> "No, Marty. You're too young to drink tea." </br> "But, why?" Marty asked. </br> "Because your fingers are too tiny to hold the cup. And tea is too hot for you, baby." </br> "I'm not a baby," Marty said. "I'm five-and-a-half."  </br> Marty went out to the yard.His brother Ralph was playing basketball.  </br> "Can I play too?" Marty asked.Ralph bounced the ball up and down under Marty's nose and then threw it into the basket.  </br> "No Marty, you're too young to play basketball."  </br> "But, why?" Marty asked.  </br> "Because the basket is too high for you to reach. And the ball is too big for your tiny baby hands," Ralph said.  </br> "I'm not a baby," Marty said. "I'm five and three quarters."  </br> Marty went into the kitchen.His sister Jane was getting ready to ride her bicycle to the candy store.  </br> "Can I go to the store to buy candy?" Marty asked Jane.He could feel the wind in his hair and the candy on his tongue.  </br> "No, you're too young to go to the store," Jane said.  </br> "But why?" Marty asked.  </br> "Because the store is too far for you to ride to. And your baby bike is too slow."  </br> "I'm not a baby," Marty said. "I'm nearly six."  </br> "Six?" Jane laughed. "You just turned five!"  </br> Marty sat on the grass and watched his sister ride away on her bike.He started to cry.Marty's father was washing the car. He heard a tiny cry and went to find out what was wrong.  </br> "Why are you crying?" Marty's father asked. </br> "Because I'm too tiny to do anything. I wish I weren't the youngest one." </br> "Be careful what you wish for," his father said. </br> Just then, Marty's mother came out to bring Marty's dad his tea.She patted her belly and smiled. </br> "We're going to have another baby," his mother said. </br> "And that means you're going to be a big brother," his father said. </br> "But, I'm too tiny to be a big brother," Marty said. "I'm just a baby!"`,
